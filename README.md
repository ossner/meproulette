Background:
I was in Strasbourg visiting the European Parliament and created this after I got home and before dinner. I got bored too quickly to improve the following issues:
1. Some MEPs don't have an official image (will show as a missing asset in the browser)
2. The next MEP will be chosen completely randomly, meaning there is a 1/704 (as of 1/2024) chance that the same MEP will appear

These issues might be fixed in the future, but this is not a huge priority at the moment :)
